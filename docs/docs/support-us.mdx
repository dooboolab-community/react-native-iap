# Support React Native IAP

`react-native-iap` is an open source project with MIT license. We are willing to
maintain this repository to support devs to monetize around the world.

Since `IAP` itself is not perfect on each platform, we desperately need
this project to be maintained. If you'd like to help us, please contact the [maintainer: dooboolab@gmail.com](mailto:dooboolab@gmail.com).
