# Troubleshooting

## Recommendations

- Before continuing any coding, ensure that you have successfully completed all forms related to agreements, bank accounts, or tax information (any bureaucratic processes associated with the app store you are using).

## Common issues

Most of the issues encountered by users are caused by:

- A device simulator. Use a real device for testing!
- An incorrect usage of the library. Read the [documentation](https://react-native-iap.dooboolab.com).

## `getProducts` returns an empty array

- Please double check if you've called `initConnection`.
- Please wait for max. 24 hours to fetch your IAP products if you've just uploaded them. [Related to issue](https://github.com/dooboolab-community/react-native-iap/issues/1065).
- For `iOS`, from iOS version `>=13`, we seem to use `StoreKit` to fix this issue as [mentioned in stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58020258/requesting-an-in-app-purchase-in-ios-13-fails/58065711#58065711).
- For `android`, please double check [issue comment here](https://github.com/dooboolab-community/react-native-iap/issues/124#issuecomment-386593185) and see if you've missed something.

## `getAvailablePurchases()` returns an empty array

- `getAvailablePurchases()` is used only when you purchase a non-consumable product. This can be restored only.
- If you want to find out if a user subscribes the product, you should check the receipt which you should store in your own database.
- Apple suggests you handle this in your own backend to do things like what you are trying to achieve.

## Invalid `productId` in iOS.

Please try below and make sure you've done all the steps:

1. Completed an effective "Agreements, Tax, and Banking."
2. Setup sandbox testing account in "Users and Roles."
3. Signed into iOS device with sandbox account in "Settings / iTunes & App Stores".

4. Set up three In-App Purchases with the following status:

   - Ready to Submit
   - Missing Metadata
   - Waiting for Review

5. Enable "In-App Purchase" in Xcode "Capabilities" and in Apple Developer -> "App ID" setting.

6. Clean up builds:
   - Delete the app on device
   - Restart device
   - Quit “store” related processes in Activity Monitor
   - Development Provisioning Profile -> Clean -> Build.
