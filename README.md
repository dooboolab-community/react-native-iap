This a react-native link library project for in-app-purchase for both android and ios project. The goal for this project is to have similar experience between the two platforms for in-app-purchase. Basically android platform has more functions for in-app-purchase and is not our specific interests for this project. However if you look inside the index.js file, you will have some more hidden android functions which won't be supported in the readme. You can look inside if you want something more in android though. Android iap is implemented with iap version 3 which is currently recent.

## Important
Please try react-native-iap@0.1.10 when ios is not working properly. Sorry that this module is still under development.
It mostly works fine in version 0.1.10 except distinguishing Non-consumable & consumable products.
We are working on it right now.

## Changelogs
- **[0.1.10]**
  + Updated Readme.
- **[0.1.9]**
  + Fixed potential bug relied on preparing IAP module in Android. Updated readme to see how to use it.
  + prepareAndroid() function is deprecated. Use prepare() instead.

#### Methods
| Func  | Param  | Return | Description |
| :------------ |:---------------:| :---------------:| :-----|
| prepare |  | `Promise` | Prepare IAP module. |
| getItems | { android: [], type, ios: [] } | `Promise` | get purchasable items in array. |
| buyItem | `string` | `Promise` | Purchase item. |
| buySubscribeItem | `string` | `Promise` | Subscribe item. |

Android: In getItems([], type) type should be null for purchase items and 'SUBS' for subscription items.

## Git repo
https://github.com/dooboolab/react-native-iap


## Getting started
`$ npm install react-native-iap --save`

### Mostly automatic installation
`$ react-native link react-native-iap`

### Manual installation

#### iOS
1. In XCode, in the project navigator, right click `Libraries` ➜ `Add Files to [your project's name]`
2. Go to `node_modules` ➜ `react-native-iap` and add `RNIap.xcodeproj`
3. In XCode, in the project navigator, select your project. Add `libRNIap.a` to your project's `Build Phases` ➜ `Link Binary With Libraries`
4. Run your project (`Cmd+R`)<

#### Android
1. Open up `android/app/src/main/java/[...]/MainActivity.java`
  - Add `import com.reactlibrary.RNIapPackage;` to the imports at the top of the file
  - Add `new RNIapPackage()` to the list returned by the `getPackages()` method
2. Append the following lines to `android/settings.gradle`:
  	```
  	include ':react-native-iap'
  	project(':react-native-iap').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, 	'../node_modules/react-native-iap/android')
  	```
3. Insert the following lines inside the dependencies block in `android/app/build.gradle`:
  	```
      compile project(':react-native-iap')
  	```
## Usage
You can look in the RNIapExample folder to try the example. Below is basic implementation which is also provided in RNIapExample project.

## Prepare IAP, In App Billing.
First thing you should do is to define your items for iOS and android separately like defined below.
```javascript
import RNIap from 'react-native-iap';

const itemSkus = {
  ios: [
    'com.cooni.point1000',
    'com.cooni.point5000',
  ],
  android: [
    'point_1000',
    '5000_point',
  ],
};
```

Next, call the prepare function (ios it's not needed, but android it is. No need to check platform though since nothing will happen in ios:

```javascript
RNIap.prepare().then(message=>{
  // Ready to call RNIap.getItems()
}).catch(errorCode=>{
  // Depending on the situation, Android will have a different error code. Handle accordingly. Visit the link below for current info
  // https://developer.android.com/reference/com/android/billingclient/api/BillingClient.BillingResponse.html
  /*
    -2: FEATURE_NOT_SUPPORTED
    -1: SERVICE_DISCONNECTED
    0: SUCCESS (should never be successful since only errors are caught)
    1: USER_CANCELED
    2: SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE
    3: BILLING_UNAVAILABLE
    4: ITEM_UNAVAILABLE
    5: DEVELOPER_ERROR
    6: ERROR
    7: ITEM_ALREADY_OWNED
    8: ITEM_NOT_OWNED
  */
})
```

## Get Valid Items
You should do prepare() in componentDidMount in necessary component.
Then call getItems().
```javascript
async componentDidMount() {
  const msg = await RNIap.prepare();
  console.log('msg: ' + msg);
  const items = await RNIap.getItems(itemSkus);
  this.setState({ items, });

  // iOS will support currency_type after v0.1.4
}
```
#### Each item is a JavaScript object containing these keys:
|    | ios | android | info |
|----|-----|---------|------|
|price| ✓ | ✓ | will return localizedPrice on Android (default), or a decimal point number on iOS (default) |
|productId| ✓ | ✓ | returns a string needed to purchase the item later |
|currency| ✓ | ✓ | returns the currency code |
|localizedPrice| ✓ | ✓ | Use localizedPrice if you want to display the price to the user so you don't need to worry about currency symbols. |
|title| ✓ | ✓ | returns the title Android and localizedTitle on iOS |
|description| ✓ | ✓ | returns the description on Android and localizedDescription on iOS |
|type|  | ✓ | returns SKU type |
|price_currency|  | ✓ | same as currency, but left in here to not break any code users may have written before |


## Purchase
Finally when you getItems with RNIap module, you can buyItem using it's api.
```javascript
  const receipt = await RNIap.buyItem('com.cooni.point1000');
  // above will return receipt string which can be used to validate on your server.
```
In RNIapExample, at receiving receipt string, main page will navigate to Second.js.

## Purchase Example 2 (Advanced)
```javascript
this.setState({progressTitle:"Please wait..."});
RNIap.buyItem('com.cooni.point1000').then(receipt=>{
    this.setState({
      receipt:receipt, // save the receipt if you need it, whether locally, or to your server.
      progressTitle:"Purchase Successful!",
      points:this.state.points + 1000
    });
  }).catch(error=>{
    // resetting UI
    this.setState({progressTitle:"Buy 1000 Points for only $0.99"})
    if (Platform.OS == 'ios') {
      if (error.code == 2) {
        // ios error.code 2 means that the user cancelled. No need to alert them. Just reset the UI.
      } else {
        // ios error.description gives a so-so English description of the error that the user should be able to understand.
        // You could also give your own descriptions based on error.code instead:  
        // https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skerror.code
        alert(error.description)
      }
    } else {
      // haven't added specific error handling yet for android. todo.
      alert("Purchase Unsuccessful");
    }
  })
```

## Subscription
```javascript
buySubscribeItem = async(sku) => {
  try {
    console.log('buyItem: ' + sku);
    const receipt = await RNIap.buyItem(sku);
    // ios case parsing  리턴값이 어레이가 아님...  0, 1 를 키로 갖는 객체임..
    console.log(receipt);
    this.setState({ receipt }, () => this.goToNext());
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(`${err}`);
    Alert.alert(`${err}`);
  }
}
```
Subscribable products can be included in item object and purchased just like consumable product.
You can cancel subscription on iOS system setting.

## Todo
iOS : restore non-consumable products via restoreCompletedTransactions()
