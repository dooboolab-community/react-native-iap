## Announcement

- Version `11.0.0` is currently in alpha candidate. The module migrates OS sdk to [storekit2](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10114). [andresesfm](https://github.com/andresesfm) is working hard on this.

  ```
  yarn add react-native-iap@next
  ```

- Version `10.0.0` is a maitenance build. Many internal refactorings and clean up of the code. Special thanks to [jeremybarbet](https://github.com/jeremybarbet) for his contributions. Most notably all methods now take an object parameter instead of separate parameters. Please help us test

- Version `9.0.0` The module migrates android sdk to [play billing library v5](https://qonversion.io/blog/google-play-billing-library-5-0). Our core maintainers [andresesfm](https://github.com/andresesfm) and [jeremybarbet](https://github.com/jeremybarbet) worked hard on this.

- Version `8.0.0` has finally landed in Jan 28th. Since this is early release, please use it with caution ðŸš§. We recommend user to use `>=8.0.0` with react-native `>=0.65.1`. The `next` package is no longer updated until we organize the roadmap for `9.0.0`.

- Version `8.0.0` is currently in release candidate. The module is completely rewritten with `Kotlin` and `Swift` for maintenenance issue by [andresesfm](https://github.com/andresesfm) ðŸ”†. You may install this for early preview.

- React Native IAP hook is out. You can see [medium post](https://medium.com/dooboolab/announcing-react-native-iap-hooks-96c7ffd3f19a) on how to use it.

- The `react-native-iap` module hasn't been maintained well recently. We are thinking of participating again and make the module healthier. Please refer to [2021 Maintenance plan](https://github.com/dooboolab/react-native-iap/issues/1241) and share with us how you or your organization is using it. Happy new year ðŸŽ‰

  - The sample code is out in [Sponsor page](https://github.com/hyochan/dooboolab.com/blob/main/src/components/pages/Sponsor.tsx) in [dooboolab.com](https://github.com/hyochan/dooboolab.com) repository which sadly is rejected by Apple because of lacking product features. I will work on another example project to support this module. More information in [#1241 commment](https://github.com/dooboolab/react-native-iap/issues/1241#issuecomment-798540785).

## Acknowledgements

If you're looking for a module going further than `react-native-iap`, we recommend using [react-native-iaphub](https://github.com/iaphub/react-native-iaphub) which is taking care of everything from the client-side to the server-side.

## Sponsoring

Since `IAP` itself is not perfect on each platform, we desperately need
