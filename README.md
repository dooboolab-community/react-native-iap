## Announcement

- Version `9.0.0` is currently in release candidate. The module migrates android sdk to [play billing library v5](https://qonversion.io/blog/google-play-billing-library-5-0) and iOS sdk to [storekit2](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10114). Our core maintainers [andresesfm](https://github.com/andresesfm) and [jeremybarbet](https://github.com/jeremybarbet) are working hard on this.

  ```
  yarn add react-native-iap@next
  ```

- Version `8.0.0` has finally landed in Jan 28th. Since this is early release, please use it with caution 🚧. We recommend user to use `>=8.0.0` with react-native `>=0.65.1`. The `next` package is no longer updated until we organize the roadmap for `9.0.0`.

- Version `8.0.0` is currently in release candidate. The module is completely rewritten with `Kotlin` and `Swift` for maintenenance issue by [andresesfm](https://github.com/andresesfm) 🔆. You may install this for early preview.

  ```
  yarn add react-native-iap@next
  ```

- React Native IAP hook is out. You can see [medium post](https://medium.com/dooboolab/announcing-react-native-iap-hooks-96c7ffd3f19a) on how to use it.

- The `react-native-iap` module hasn't been maintained well recently. We are thinking of participating again and make the module healthier. Please refer to [2021 Maintenance plan](https://github.com/dooboolab/react-native-iap/issues/1241) and share with us how you or your organization is using it. Happy new year 🎉

  - The sample code is out in [Sponsor page](https://github.com/hyochan/dooboolab.com/blob/main/src/components/pages/Sponsor.tsx) in [dooboolab.com](https://github.com/hyochan/dooboolab.com) repository which sadly is rejected by Apple because of lacking product features. I will work on another example project to support this module. More information in [#1241 commment](https://github.com/dooboolab/react-native-iap/issues/1241#issuecomment-798540785).

## Introduction

This react-native module will help you access the In-app purchases capabilities of your phone on the `Android`, `iOS` platforms and the `Amazon` platform (Beta).

**Keep in mind** `react-native-iap` will provide the basic features you need but is not a turnkey solution, implementing In-app purchases in your app will still require quite some work.<br/>
Also, implementing the client side is only one side of the coin, you'll have to implement the server side to validate your receipts (which is probably the most time consuming part to do it correctly).

If you're looking for a module going further than react-native-iap, we recommend using [react-native-iaphub](https://github.com/iaphub/react-native-iaphub) which is taking care of everything from the client side to the server side.

⚠️ Most of users experiencing issues are caused by:

- A device simulator, use a real device for testing!
- The sandbox environment of the project not being configured properly ([Configure android sandbox](https://www.iaphub.com/docs/set-up-android/configure-sandbox-testing), [Configure ios sandbox](https://www.iaphub.com/docs/set-up-ios/configure-sandbox-testing/))
- An incorrect usage of the library

## Quick News

- We had hard time supporting `react-native-iap` issues that did not provide working codes or any other examples. Therefore, we've decided to make an `example` app called [DoobooIAP](https://github.com/hyochan/DoobooIAP), which will contain all the features of `IAP`'s and willing to continuously improve to support real-life examples. [@Bang9](http://github.com/bang9) who had been helping many others for `react-native-iap`, is willing to support this repo so he will grant $300 of our income in `opencollective` as described in [#855](https://github.com/dooboolab/react-native-iap/issues/855) :tada:.
- `react-native-iap@4.0.8` ~ `react-native-iap@4.1.0` is incompatible with `react-native <0.61`. This is fixed in `react-native-iap@4.1.1` and above.
- `react-native-iap@4.0.0` has been released. You can see [#716](https://github.com/dooboolab/react-native-iap/pull/716) for updates.
- In the past, `react-native-iap@^3.*` has been updated very promptly for migration issues.
  Don't get surprised too much on why it is bumping up version so quickly these days.
  1. Migrated to new `AndroidX` APIs.
  2. Migrated to new `Android` billing client which is `> 2.0.0`.
     - [`acknowledgePurchase()`][android-acknowledge-purchase] has been added since `3.2.0` which is very important.
  3. New [Purchase Flow][a-purchase-flow]
  4. More is coming in `iOS 13`.

## Breaking Changes

[7.4.0]

- Now using React's Context to manage IAP state
- Introduce `withIAPContext` HOC ([how to use](docs/docs/usage_instructions/using_hooks.md))

[7.1.0]

- `androidOldSku` is no longer required [#1438](https://github.com/dooboolab/react-native-iap/pull/1438).

[6.1.0]

- Creates two variants: `play` and `amazon` and only uses the required code.
  ```
  NOTE: This would be a breaking change with a very simple fix described in the documentation. To add: `missingDimensionStrategy 'store', 'play'` `in build.gradle`
  ```
  [3.0.0+]
